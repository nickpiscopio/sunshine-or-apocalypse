# Sunshine or Apocalypse
This is a fun little weather application.

## How to use
Currently the application hardcodes the lat long. I will be adding a conversion of a user's city they after they type in that information in the search textfield.

I have removed the appId from the code (line 72 of SearchView.swift) because I didn't want to commit that to source control.

To get a key, you just need to go to https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys and request one. One thing I didn't know is that it takes a little bit for the key to officially activate. I found that out here: https://openweathermap.org/faq#error401
